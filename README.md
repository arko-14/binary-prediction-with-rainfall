## Rainfall prediction model

## Overview

In this notebook, we address the problem of predicting rainfall using a binary classification approach. The project demonstrates how combining models through ensemble techniques can improve predictive performance over single classifiers.

This is a Kaggle competition

Key highlights include:

- Implementation of **Bagging** using Random Forest and Logistic Regression as base estimators.
- Construction of a **Stacking Ensemble** that leverages multiple base learners (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and a meta-model for improved accuracy.
- Detailed evaluation of model performance using accuracy scores.
- Step-by-step explanation of the techniques and hyperparameter tuning strategies employed.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to develop a model that predicts whether it will rain or not (binary outcome) based on weather-related features. This involves:

- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and preprocessing relevant features.
- **Modeling:** Training multiple models and combining their predictions.
- **Evaluation:** Measuring model performance using cross-validation and test set metrics.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project contains weather-related measurements (such as temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) along with a target variable indicating rainfall occurrence (0 or 1).

- **Source:** (Datasets are obtained from kaggle)
- **Preprocessing:**
    - Missing values are handled appropriately.
    - Features are scaled/normalized where necessary.
    - The data is split into training and test sets.

## Techniques and Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- **Cleaning:** Removing or imputing missing values.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant predictors for rainfall.
- **Splitting:** Dividing the data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.

### Base Models

The following models are used as building blocks:

- **Logistic Regression:** A linear model used as a baseline and also as a meta-model in the stacking ensemble.
- **Random Forest:** A bagging-based ensemble that reduces variance by averaging multiple decision trees.
- **XGBoost:** An advanced gradient boosting model that iteratively corrects errors made by previous models.

### Ensemble Methods

- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):**
    - Separate bagging classifiers were built using Random Forest and Logistic Regression as base estimators.
    - Each bagging model trains multiple copies of the base estimator on bootstrapped samples.
- **Stacking:**
    - Base models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) are trained in parallel.
    - Their predictions are used as input features to a meta-model (typically Logistic Regression) which makes the final prediction.
    - This technique leverages the strengths of each model and often improves overall accuracy.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- **Grid Search / Randomized Search:**
    - Systematic exploration of hyperparameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, etc., for models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
    - Cross-validation (e.g., 10-fold) is used during tuning to prevent overfitting and to ensure robust evaluation.
- **Fine-Tuning the Meta-Model:**
    - After optimizing the base models, the meta-model is also tuned to learn the best way to combine base predictions.
